    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: white;">HISTORY OF NIGERIA</h1>
    <p>The History of Nigeria can be traced to settlers trading across the middle East and Africa as early as 1100 BC.
        Numerous ancient African civilizations settled in the region that is known today as Nigeria, such as the Kingdom
        of Nri, the Benin Empire, and the Oyo Empire. Islam reached Nigeria through the Bornu Empire between (1068 AD)
        and Hausa States around (1385 AD) during the 11th century,while Christianity came to Nigeria in the
        15th century through Augustinian and Capuchin monks from Portugal. The Songhai Empire also occupied part of the
        region.From the 15th century, European slave traders arrived in the region to purchase enslaved Africans as
        part of the Atlantic slave trade, which started in the region of modern-day Nigeria; the first Nigerian port
        used by European slave traders was Badagry, a coastal harbour. Local merchants provided them with slaves,
        escalating conflicts among the ethnic groups in the region and disrupting older trade patterns through the
        Trans-Saharan route.</p>

    <h2> Pre-History of Nigeria</h2>
    <p> Kainji Dam excavations revealed ironworking by the 2nd century BC. The transition from Neolithic times to the
        Iron Age apparently was achieved without intermediate bronze production. Others suggest the technology moved
        west from the Nile Valley, although the Iron Age in the Niger Rivervalley and the forest region appears to
        predate the introduction of metallurgy in the upper savanna by more than 800 years.</p>

    <p> The Nok civilization of Nigeria flourished between 1,500 BC and AD 200. It produced life-sized terracotta
        figures that are some of the earliest known sculptures in Sub-Saharan Africa and smelted
        iron by about 550 BC and possibly a few centuries earlier.Evidence of iron smelting has also been
        excavated at sites in the Nsukka region of southeast Nigeria: dating to 2000 BC at the site of Lejja and to
        750 BC and at the site of Opi.</p>
    <h2>Early History of Nigeria</h2>
    <p> The Kano Chronicle highlights an ancient history dating to around 999 AD of the Hausa Sahelian city-state of
        Kano, with other major Hausa cities (or Hausa Bakwai) of: Daura, Hadeija, Kano, Katsina, Zazzau, Rano, and Gobir
        all having recorded histories dating back to the 10th century. With the spread of Islam from the 7th century AD,
        the area became known as Sudan or as Bilad Al Sudan (English: Land of the Blacks; Arabic: بلاد السودان). Since
        the populations were partially affiliated with the Arab Muslim culture of North Africa, they began Trans-Saharan
        trade and were referred to by the Arabic speakers as Al-Sudan (meaning "The Blacks") as they were considered an
        extended part of the Muslim world. There are early historical references by medieval Arab and Muslim historians
        and geographers which refer to the Kanem-Bornu Empire as the region's major centre for Islamic civilization.</p>

    <h2> Pre-colonial era</h2>
    <p> In the 16th century, Portuguese explorers were the first Europeans to begin significant, direct trade with
        peoples of southern Nigeria, at the port they named Lagos (formerly Eko) and in Calabar along the region Slave
        Coast. Europeans traded goods with peoples at the coast; coastal trade with Europeans also marked the beginnings
        of the Atlantic slave trade. The port of Calabar on the historical Bight of Biafra (now commonly referred to
        as the Bight of Bonny) became one of the largest slave trading posts in West Africa in the era of the
        transatlantic slave trade. Other major slaving ports in Nigeria were located in Badagry, Lagos on the Bight of
        Benin and on Bonny Island on the Bight of Biafra. The majority of those enslaved and taken to these
        ports were captured in raids and wars. Usually the captives were taken back to the conquerors' territory as
        forced labour; after time, they were sometimes acculturated and absorbed into the conquerors' society. Slave
        routes were established throughout Nigeria linking the hinterland areas with the major coastal ports. Some of
        the more prolific slave trading kingdoms who participated in the transatlantic slave trade were linked with the
        Edo's Benin Empire in the south, Oyo Empire in the southwest, and the Aro Confederacy in the southeast.[38][39]
        Benin's power lasted between the 15th and 19th centuries. Oyo, at its territorial zenith in the late 17th to
        early 18th centuries, extended its influence from western Nigeria to modern-day Togo.</p><br>
