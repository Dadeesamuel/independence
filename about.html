    <h1 style="color: white;text-align: center;"> NIGERIA</h1>
    <p > Nigeria officially the Federal Republic of Nigeria, is a country in West Africa. It is
        the most populous country in Africa; geographically situated between the Sahel to the north, and the Gulf of
        Guinea to the south in the Atlantic Ocean; covering an area of 923,769 kilometres (574,003 mi), with a
        population of over 211 million. It borders Niger in the north, Chad in the northeast, Cameroon in the east, and
        Benin in the west. Nigeria is a federal republic comprising 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, where
        the capital, Abuja, is located. </p>
    <p> The largest city in Nigeria is Lagos, one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world and second largest in
        Africa. Nigeria became a formally independent federation on October 1, 1960.</p>
    <p> Nigeria is a multinational state inhabited by more than 250 ethnic groups speaking 500 distinct languages, all
        identifying with a wide variety of cultures.</p><br>
    <h1 style="color: white;text-align: center;"> THE THREE LARGEST ETHNIC GROUP IN NIGERIA</h1><br>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"> The Hausa-Fulani in North</h3><br>
    <div style="display: flex ;">
        <img src="image/hausa.jpg" width="50%" style="float: left;">
        <p style="float: right;">Hausa–Fulani are an ethnolinguistic group of the Sudan (Arabic: السودان), a vast region
            south of the Sahara,
            encompassing the Sahel (Arabic: ساحل), they are located primarily in the Northern region of Nigeria where
            they make up about 36% of the total population. Hausa-Fulani are people of mixed Hausa and Fulani origin,
            most of whom speak a variant of Hausa as their native language, although about 12 to 15 million speak Fula
            language called Fulfulde.</p>
    </div><br>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"> The Yoruba in West</h3><br>
    <div style="display: flex ;">
        <img src="image/yoruba.jpeg" width="50%" style="float: left;">
        <p style="float: right;"> The Yoruba people (Yoruba: Ọmọ Káàárọ̀-oòjíire, Ọmọ Oòduà) are a native West African
            ethnic
            group that inhabit western Africa, in mainly the parts of Nigeria, Benin, and Togo that constitute
            Yorubaland. The Yoruba constitute around 38 million people in Africa, a few hundred thousand outside of its
            continental borders, and bear some further representation among members of the African diaspora. The vast
            majority of the Yoruba population is today within the country of Nigeria, where the Yoruba make up 15.5% of
            the country's population by contemporary estimations, making them one of the largest ethnic groups in
            Africa, by number. Most Yoruba people speak the Yoruba language, which is, also, the Niger-Congo language
            with the largest number of native speakers.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"> The Igbo in East</h3><br>
    <div style="display: flex ;">
        <img src="image/igbo.jpg" width="50%" style="float: left;">
        <p style="float: right;"> The Igbo people are a meta-ethnicity native to present-day south-central and southeastern Nigeria. Large
            ethnic Igbo populations are found in Cameroon, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea, as well as outside
            Africa. There has been much speculation about the origins of the Igbo people, as it is unknown how exactly
            the group came to form. Geographically, the Igbo homeland is divided into two unequal sections by the
            Niger River – an eastern (which is the larger of the two) and a western section. The Igbo people are
            one of the largest ethnic groups in Africa.

            The Igbo language is a part of the Niger-Congo language family. It is divided into numerous regional
            dialects and somewhat mutually intelligible with the larger "Igboid" cluster. The Igbo homeland
            straddles the lower Niger River, east and south of the Edoid and Idomoid groups, and west of the Ibibioid
            (Cross River) cluster.</p>
